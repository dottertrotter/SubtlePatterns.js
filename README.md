SubtlePatterns.js is a small node.js application that makes testing out various backgrounds from subtlepatterns.com on a live website a cinch.

You can download the source and run it yourself, or you can go to [subtlepatternsjs.herokuapp.com](http://subtlepatternsjs.herokuapp.com) and use that instead.

If you have any suggestions, just let me know.
